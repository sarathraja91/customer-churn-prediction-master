# Customer churn prediction

## Description
We are trying to build a model which predicts whether a person purchases an item present in his or her cart on a e-commerce platform.


## Data Exploration

1. Slice and dice data to understand each attribute
2. Generate plots to understand the distribution

## Feature Engineering

1. Advanced EDA
2. Splitting category code at two levels
3. Capture User activity (session count, total activity in session, product affinity)
3. Binning hours in 4 bucket
4. Reduction in brands 
5. Generate Target variable

## Model selection

1. Evaluate these algorithm
	- Logistic Regression 
	- Decision Tree
	- Random Forest
2. Hyperparameter Tunning (ParamGridBuilder)
3. Threshold selection

## Model Inference

1. Feature Importance
2. Model implications
